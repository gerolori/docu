## Install the drivers

Those are usually pre installed, but you might have to do so manually.

Download them [here](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads), extract the zip then click install after right clicking on the "silabser.inf" file (these are the instructions for windows).

After doing that reboot your pc.

## Flashing

I chose to install [XZG](https://xzg.xyzroe.cc/install/) but I'm pretty sure it works with the [UZG](https://uzg.zig-star.com/webinstall/) page too.

- Open one of the links above with a Chrome based browser.
- Hold down the reset button on the back of the uzg-01 poe.
- Plug it in a usb port of your pc (still holding the button down), I used a port directly on the motherboard and not one on the front IO, I think it was part of the problem why it wasn't working.
- Then, while still keeping the button pressed, press on install and select your device from the dropdown.
- Press "Install XZG firmware"
- If you're only seeing the "Preparing installation" text for 30s or more it probably failed, if it goes to "Erasing data" after a few sec it should be going well.
- Wait a couple of minutes until it finishes and then you can unplug it

Enjoy the new fresh install.
